# Showdown API PoCs
 Tests of the capabilities of the Showdown API

## Warning
Since this is a PoC, I haven't really bothered to do a lot of things correctly. Note the following idiosyncrasies:
- This PoC uses a [custom version of the Pokemon Showdown module](https://github.com/JacenBoy/pokemon-showdown)
- The PoC (particularly the `repull` script) assumes the modified Showdown module is cloned into the same directory that you cloned this repo into
- Make sure you run `npm run build` on the Showdown repo before you try to use this one
